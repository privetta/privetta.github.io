    "text": "OutRush, Panel-survey of Political Russian Migrants: 2022 —\nOutRush focuses on political migrants who left Russia after 2022 invasion of Ukraine. OutRush employs a panel methodology, providing real-time insights about the dynamic of situation of Russian migrants by consistently surveying the same individuals every 12 months on various aspects like political behaviour, fears and expectations, and intergration.\n\nSince its inception in March 2022, the project has effectively monitored the changing attitudes and actions of Russian migrants, conducting four survey waves in 2.5 years. It has involved over 13,000 participants now located in more than a hundred countries. The project has garnered substantial international media coverage and has drawn the attention of policymakers and experts. Crucially, it has also earned the trust and interest of Russian migrants.\n\n\nViolenceMonitor, Survey on Intimate Partner Violence in Russia: 2021 - 2022\nViolenceMonitor is the first survey on intimate partner violence in Russia in 15 years, conducted in 2022. We used UN methodology and 4 survey methods, including two experimental ones. Over 4000 men and women participated in the survey. We discovered the prevalence of intimate partner violence in Russia, identified its impacts, determined the groups most vulnerable to it, and found out whom victims seek assistance from."
