    "text": "OutRush, Panel-survey of Political Russian Migrants: 2022 —\nOutRush focuses on political migrants who left Russia after 2022 invasion of Ukraine. OutRush employs a panel methodology, providing real-time insights about the dynamic of situation of Russian migrants by consistently surveying the same individuals every six months on various aspects like economic stability, fears and expectations, and political activity.\n\nSince its inception in March 2022, the project has effectively monitored the changing attitudes and actions of Russian migrants, conducting three survey waves in 1.5 years. It has involved over 10,000 participants now located in more than a hundred countries. The project has garnered substantial international media coverage and has drawn the attention of policymakers and experts. Crucially, it has also earned the trust and interest of Russian migrants.\n\n\nViolenceMonitor, Survey on Intimate Partner Violence in Russia: 2021 - 2022\nViolenceMonitor is the first survey on intimate partner violence in Russia in 15 years, conducted in 2022. We used UN methodology and 4 survey methods, including two experimental ones. Over 4000 men and women participated in the survey. We discovered the prevalence of intimate partner violence in Russia, identified its impacts, determined the groups most vulnerable to it, and found out whom victims seek assistance from."

Nugumanova.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gender dynamics in political activism have come to the fore. While the media has reported extensively on the rise of a feminist anti-war resistance movement, the question remains whether there are indeed tangible gender differences in the political behaviour of post-war migrants and, if so, what factors underpin these differences. Although historical narratives depict politics as a predominantly male domain, with women traditionally showing lower levels of political engagement, recent shifts suggest a more complex landscape. Analyzing data from the OutRush panel survey, this study reveals that women, despite reporting heightened feelings of depression and a bleak outlook, consistently exhibit increased political and civic activism compared to men—except in assistance to fellow Russians. Intriguingly, conventional indicators, such as political interest and trust, displayed no gender disparity. A regression analysis posits that feelings of responsibility and the urge for reparations account for the observed gender gap, suggesting that these emotions might play a pivotal role in fueling women’s political fervor. To refine our understanding of gendered motivations, a forthcoming Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis will examine whether emotions such as responsibility and reparations drive political and civic engagement differently across genders. The quantitative data is complemented by extensive qualitative research, including interviews with numerous feminist anti-war resistance activists. These interviews explore their personal views on the contrasting experiences of male and female activists, and examines how gender norms and institutional frameworks in their host countries either support or hinder their activist endeavours. This research hopes to illuminate the intricate tapestry of gendered political activism in post-war migration scenarios.\n\nMeasuring Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence from Field and Survey Experiments. Co-authored with E. Kamalov\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIntimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a multifaceted issue that has seen a concerning rise during the global COVID-19 pandemic. While accurate data on IPV prevalence is essential for targeted interventions, traditional administrative data often falls short due to the private nature of IPV and victims’ hesitance to seek aid. Sociological surveys, though promising, grapple with challenges like social desirability bias. This study, set against the backdrop of Russia—a country with sparse reliable IPV data—compares various IPV measurement approaches with the face-to-face survey as the benchmark. Our findings reveal that online surveys, devoid of enumerator presence, most effectively capture IPV prevalence rates in Russia. Specifically, these online methods outperformed list experiments and self-administered questionnaires. Notably, women demonstrated a higher IPV disclosure rate in online surveys compared to face-to-face interviews. This research not only underscores the importance of methodological considerations in IPV data collection but also emphasizes the superior efficacy of online surveys in capturing genuine IPV experiences, especially among women.\n\nHelping to flee a political crisis: a Conjoint Experiment of Russian Migrants. Co-authored with E. Kamalov\n\n\nAbstract\n\nPolitical crises often provoke mass waves of migration. The most evident examples include the Cuban revolution in 1959, the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, the crisis in Venezuela in 2019, and most recently, the crisis in Russia in 2022. These events resulted in mass exoduses, with millions fleeing their homes due to political turmoil. Support from the migrant community can be vital for those trying to escape such dire political situations. Although much research has delved into host countries’ perceptions of migrants, the migrants’ own views on whom to assist remain less explored. Through the lens of deservingness, this study uses a choice-based conjoint experiment to gauge the attitudes of Russian migrants who left Russia following the onset of its military intervention in Ukraine in 2022. Our findings indicate a preference among these migrants to assist compatriots fleeing due to political reasons, especially if they experience state persecution. We argue this to reflect a sense of political solidarity among emigrants. The context of the political crisis is important: migrants often favor those directly impacted by the crisis and war, including journalists, people of Ukrainian ethnic background, and ethnic minorities heavily conscripted into the conflict. Decisions on assistance are also influenced by factors like age, occupation, gender, and family status.\n\nThe effect of discrimination on the political behavior of recent migrants: evidence from three waves of the panel survey of new Russian migrants. Co-authored with E. Kamalov\n\n\nAbstract\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hundreds of thousands of migrants have left Russia, settling in various countries with differing historical relations with Russia and diverse responses from host governments and local populations to this influx. Based on a model of identity formation, we propose that the more discrimination an individual faces, the less likely they feel connected to the host society and integrate. But ff Russian migrants do not identify with their host society, the question arises: where do they find a sense of belonging? Do they feel a stronger identification with the community of Russian emigrants, with those who remain in Russia, or with citizens of future Russia? To explore these questions, we analyze data from three waves of a unique panel survey focusing on new Russian migrants who left Russia after February 24, 2022. The survey tool not only validates the classical theoretical assumption but also uncovers the various identity formation strategies triggered by discrimination. The panel structure of the survey enables us to examine the mechanisms through which discrimination impacts the identity of recent migrants.\n\nDemocracy in Exile? Trajectories of Russian Anti-War Migrants in Eurasia. Co-authored with M. Zavadskaya and I. Sergeeva.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nCan citizens continue to participate in the politics of their home country after migrating to another country? Many examples exist of migrants engaging in their countries of origin’s political affairs, such as expatriate voting, forming political communities and hometown associations, donating money to political movements and politicians, advocating for migrants’ rights, and other forms of political participation. However, it remains unclear why migrants are willing to continue exercising their ‘voice’ after ‘exit’ and what the main challenges and obstacles are for them to do so while abroad. In this chapter, we analyze the patterns of civic and political engagement among Russian migrants who fled their home country following the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Drawing on scholarship in migration studies, we view exit and voice not as mutually exclusive but as mutually reinforcing alternatives. We argue that the way migrants connect with their homeland plays a crucial role in mobilizing and demobilizing them, particularly the connections they have with their employers. The incentives provided by employers may force migrants to dampen their propensity to engage in political activities. To support our argument, we rely on an original survey conducted in March-April and September 2022, as well as semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Turkey.\n\nCan media framing increase support for health reform?
