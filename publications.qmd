[You Can Leave The Autocracy, But Will The Autocracy Leave You? Subjective Well-being of Russian Political Migrants in 2022](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2wmuy)

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*Due to political crises, millions of people have moved beyond their autocratic home countries in search of a more secure life. However, the influence and control of these autocratic regimes often follow them on this journey. By examining the case of Russian emigration following the full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we demonstrate how the direct and indirect actions of autocratic home countries can undermine the subjective well-being of migrants. Utilizing a unique panel survey and in-depth interviews, our findings reveal that the actions of autocratic home countries are significantly connected to the migrants' well-being, often more so than traditional determinants like income and employment. Fears of transnational repression, instilled by the Russian government and widespread among Russian migrants, correlate with a reduction in subjective well-being comparable to the effects of income loss and unemployment. Notably, the fear of discrimination, stemming from a host-country backlash against the actions of autocrats, has a more detrimental effect on well-being than experienced discrimination, highlighting the psychological toll of anticipatory fears. The study also finds that group-based guilt and a sense of responsibility for Russia's actions in Ukraine may further exacerbate subjective well-being of migrants. The paper concludes that autocratic regimes maintain a substantial influence on the lives of their emigrants, frequently intensifying the potential negative impact of host countries. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex factors affecting the well-being of individuals forced to emigrate due to political crises. It also sheds light on how autocrats potentially diminish the resilience of political migrants to engage in home-country politics by undermining their psychological resources for action.*

[Voice after Exit? Exploring Civic Activism among Russian Migrant Communities in Eurasia after February 24, 2022](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3dnsv)

</details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*Can citizens continue to participate in the politics of their home country after migrating to another country? Many examples exist of migrants engaging in their countries of origin's political affairs, such as expatriate voting, forming political communities and hometown associations, donating money to political movements and politicians, advocating for migrants' rights, and other forms of political participation. However, it remains unclear why migrants are willing to continue exercising their 'voice' after 'exit' and what the main challenges and obstacles are for them to do so while abroad. In this chapter, we analyze the patterns of civic and political engagement among Russian migrants who fled their home country following the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Drawing on scholarship in migration studies, we view exit and voice not as mutually exclusive but as mutually reinforcing alternatives. We argue that the way migrants connect with their homeland plays a crucial role in mobilizing and demobilizing them, particularly the connections they have with their employers. The incentives provided by employers may force migrants to dampen their propensity to engage in political activities. To support our argument, we rely on an original survey conducted in March-April and September 2022, as well as semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Turkey.*

Measuring Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence from Field and Survey Experiments. Co-authored with E. Kamalov

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a multifaceted issue that has seen a concerning rise during the global COVID-19 pandemic. While accurate data on IPV prevalence is essential for targeted interventions, traditional administrative data often falls short due to the private nature of IPV and victims' hesitance to seek aid. Sociological surveys, though promising, grapple with challenges like social desirability bias. This study, set against the backdrop of Russia---a country with sparse reliable IPV data---compares various IPV measurement approaches with the face-to-face survey as the benchmark. Our findings reveal that online surveys, devoid of enumerator presence, most effectively capture IPV prevalence rates in Russia. Specifically, these online methods outperformed list experiments and self-administered questionnaires. Notably, women demonstrated a higher IPV disclosure rate in online surveys compared to face-to-face interviews. This research not only underscores the importance of methodological considerations in IPV data collection but also emphasizes the superior efficacy of online surveys in capturing genuine IPV experiences, especially among women.*

Helping to flee a political crisis: a Conjoint Experiment of Russian Migrants. Co-authored with E. Kamalov

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*Political crises often provoke mass waves of migration. The most evident examples include the Cuban revolution in 1959, the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, the crisis in Venezuela in 2019, and most recently, the crisis in Russia in 2022. These events resulted in mass exoduses, with millions fleeing their homes due to political turmoil. Support from the migrant community can be vital for those trying to escape such dire political situations. Although much research has delved into host countries' perceptions of migrants, the migrants' own views on whom to assist remain less explored. Through the lens of deservingness, this study uses a choice-based conjoint experiment to gauge the attitudes of Russian migrants who left Russia following the onset of its military intervention in Ukraine in 2022. Our findings indicate a preference among these migrants to assist compatriots fleeing due to political reasons, especially if they experience state persecution. We argue this to reflect a sense of political solidarity among emigrants. The context of the political crisis is important: migrants often favor those directly impacted by the crisis and war, including journalists, people of Ukrainian ethnic background, and ethnic minorities heavily conscripted into the conflict. Decisions on assistance are also influenced by factors like age, occupation, gender, and family status.*

The effect of discrimination on the political behavior of recent migrants: evidence from three waves of the panel survey of new Russian migrants. Co-authored with E. Kamalov

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hundreds of thousands of migrants have left Russia, settling in various countries with differing historical relations with Russia and diverse responses from host governments and local populations to this influx. Based on a model of identity formation, we propose that the more discrimination an individual faces, the less likely they feel connected to the host society and integrate. But ff Russian migrants do not identify with their host society, the question arises: where do they find a sense of belonging? Do they feel a stronger identification with the community of Russian emigrants, with those who remain in Russia, or with citizens of future Russia? To explore these questions, we analyze data from three waves of a unique panel survey focusing on new Russian migrants who left Russia after February 24, 2022. The survey tool not only validates the classical theoretical assumption but also uncovers the various identity formation strategies triggered by discrimination. The panel structure of the survey enables us to examine the mechanisms through which discrimination impacts the identity of recent migrants.
