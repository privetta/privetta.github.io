I am a PhD researcher in the [Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu) (EUI), Florence. I study political behavior, violence, repressions and war-induced Russian emigration. I love statistics, experimental and surveys methods.

Prior to EUI I was working as a junior research fellow at [Ronald F. Inglehart Laboratory for Comparative Social Research](https://lcsr.hse.ru/en/) and taught quantitative methods at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) (HSE) and [European University at Saint Petersburg](https://eusp.org/en). I received a Master's degree in Social Sciences from HSE, and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from a university in the middle of Russia. I also happen to have a [Candidate of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_of_Sciences) degree in Social Philosophy.

With [Ivetta Sergeeva](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=ivetta-sergeeva), I am a co-founder and co-principal investigator of two multi-wave survey projects: [OutRush](https://outrush.io/eng) and [ViolenceMonitor](https://violencemonitor.org/). OutRush is a panel survey of war-induced Russian emigrants who left Russia after 24 February, 2022. ViolenceMonitor is a series of intimate partner violence victimization surveys that took place in 2021 in Russia.
