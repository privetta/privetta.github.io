I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, based at the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law. Additionally, I am a co-principal investigator for the [DemEx project](https://www.transatlanticplatform.com/demex/), co-funded by NSF. I hold a PhD in Social and Political Sciences from the European University Institute (EUI), Florence.

My research focuses on topics related to authoritarianism, civil society, and emigration. I use a mixed-methods approach with an emphasis on surveys, experiments, statistical modeling, and interviews. In addition to research skills, I have eight years of experience working as a project coordinator in civil society and human rights initiatives in the challenging environment of contemporary Russia.

In collaboration with [Emil Kamalov](https://emilkamalov.com/), I've co-founded and co-lead two research projects. The first project, [OutRush](https://outrush.io/eng), is a panel survey of Russian political migrants, initiated as both a personal and professional reaction to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The second project, [Violence Monitor](violencemonitor.org), is a national survey addressing intimate partner violence in Russia that integrates UN methodologies with experimental techniques.
