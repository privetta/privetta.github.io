Design an abstract logo for a personal webpage focused on social sciences and statistics. The central image should be a globe or oval, with an abstract representation of a sloth figure at its center. Around this figure, place scattered dots connected by thin lines to form a constellation, representing interconnected data points. The color scheme should be a mix of cool blues and warm golds or coppers, with the sloth in warm tones and the constellation in cool tones. Overlay a subtle graph line or bar graph in the background. Pair this with a modern, sans-serif font displaying the initials or name associated with the webpage

Create a minimalist black and white silhouette of a sloth hanging on a tree branch. The sloth and branch should be in black against a white background. Ensure the design is simplistic with clear, recognizable features of a sloth
